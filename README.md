## 🧠 RAG Basics with LangChain + OpenAI API

This program introduces the fundamentals of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using 📄 local markdown documents as a knowledge base. It leverages **LangChain** to load, split, and prepare documents, enabling intelligent retrieval of information using models like `gpt-4o-mini` 🧑‍💻. The environment is configured via `.env`, and documents are organized, chunked, and inspected for relevant keywords (like "CEO") 🕵️‍♂️. 

Through this project, you're learning how RAG systems fetch contextually relevant data from custom sources 🔍 and how to pre-process knowledge efficiently before feeding it to LLMs for question answering or summarization 💡.
